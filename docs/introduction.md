# What is Cloud?

Cloud is [AusOcean's](https://ausocean.org) open source repository for cloud based services. This includes OceanBench, OceanTV,
OceanCenter, OceanCron, and DataBlue. Together, these services provide a IoT device monitoring, control, and streaming platform.

# CloudBlue

Currently, AusOcean hosts all of the cloud services, with the user facing app accessible at [CloudBlue](https://bench.cloudblue.org).
If you would like to use CloudBlue to manage an IoT device, or your AusOcean product, contact [info@ausocean.org](mailto:info@ausocean.org)
to get access.
